# Assignment: Probability Calculator for N-sided Dice
AD 315 Assignment

## Objective
Develop a program that calculates the probability distribution when rolling M number of N-sided dice.

## Task 1: Implementing the Dice Roll Function
Write a Python function that simulates rolling M number of N-sided dice once and returns the sum of the outcomes.

## Task 2: Simulating Multiple Rolls
Create a function to simulate rolling M number of N-sided dice K times and record the results.

## Task 3: Calculating Probability Distribution
Write a function to calculate the probability of each possible sum when M number of N-sided dice are rolled.

## Task 4: User Interface
Allow the user to input the values of N, M, K and display the probability distribution.

## Get started 
Enter `python {filename}` in your terminal to run the code
